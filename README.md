# Identification-App
This Flutter code creates a simple ID Card app that displays an employee's information on a card-like interface. The app showcases the employee's name, current position, and email address, along with a profile picture.

Key Components of the Code:

1.MaterialApp: The MaterialApp widget is the root of the app. It sets up the basic structure and theme for the app.

2.EmployeeCard StatelessWidget: This is the main component of the app. It defines the layout and design of the ID card.

3.Scaffold: The Scaffold widget provides the basic structure for the app, including an app bar and a body area.

4.AppBar: The AppBar widget represents the app bar at the top of the screen. It displays the title "ID Card" and has a grey background.

5.Padding and Column: The Padding widget adds padding around the content of the Column widget, which arranges its children in a vertical layout. The Column contains the various components of the ID card, such as the profile picture, name, position, and email.

6.CircleAvatar: The CircleAvatar widget displays the profile picture of the employee as a circular image. It uses an image asset from the "assets" folder.

7.Text: The Text widget is used to display the various text elements on the ID card, such as the employee's name, position, and email. Different text styles are applied using TextStyle properties, including color, font size, and letter spacing.

8.Divider: The Divider widget adds a horizontal line that separates the different sections of the ID card.

Description of the App:

The app is a simple ID card representation for an employee named "Ujjwal Singh." 
It displays a circular profile picture at the center, followed by the employee's name, "Ujjwal Singh," and his current position, "Member, SEDS VIT." 
Each piece of information is styled with different font sizes and letter spacing to provide emphasis.
Below the position, the employee's email address, "ujjwal@gmail.com," is displayed with an email icon to its left.
The app's color scheme features a grey background with amber-colored text for highlighted information, providing a visually appealing design.
Overall, this app showcases a basic implementation of an employee ID card using Flutter, 
and it can be further expanded and customized to add more features and functionalities, such as additional employee details and interactive elements.
